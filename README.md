# Miscellaneous

## What is it

This is a repo for playgrounds, demos and experiments of all sorts of frameworks and tools.

## Why

There are lots of frameworks and tools for me to choose when I build up projects, and sometimes I need to do some comparisons among those frameworks and tools in various apsects. 

However, it can be quite a hassle to find a place to try them, especially when I want to save the demos and refer to them when I need. 

Of course, I can create repos for each of the demo, but that would propably end up being so many repos and it could be hard to find when I want to refer to one of them.

What's more, it can provide me a sense of collection, which makes me easy to just start to try the new thing I find out.
